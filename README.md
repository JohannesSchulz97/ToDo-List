# To-Do List App with FastAPI

A simple to-do list application built with FastAPI and JavaScript, showcasing API integration and basic frontend functionalities.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the list
- View all tasks in real-time
- Persistent server-side task management (in-memory for now)

## Tech Stack

- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Hosting: Uvicorn

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-app.git
    cd todo-list-app

2. Install dependencies:

    pip install fastapi uvicorn

3. Run the FastAPI server:

    uvicorn main:app --reload

4. Access the app in your browser at:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000

## API Endpoints

- POST /tasks â€” Add a new task (expects JSON payload)

Example payload for adding a task:

    {
      "task": "Buy groceries"
    }
